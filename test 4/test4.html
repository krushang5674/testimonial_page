  <p id="phone-paragraph">"I started talking to Dhaval somewhere in the month of August 2017 and trust me, I’ve realised tons of things about myself which I wouldn’t have figured out, even 5 years from now.Back then, I was a very emotional person and I wasnt able to concentrate on anything else but my problems, whether they were mine or my friends. But now, I’m a totally different person in that aspect. I am able to think of solutions to my problems and give space to people to solve their own without getting hassled.Career wise, Holistree made my vision clear and my dedication level has increased to another level. Being 100% honest, Holistree has helped me a lot in my journey."

  <p id="phone-paragraph">"For my husband and me, Dhaval came as a godsend. He was the missing link in our family. The changes are slow and steady in our son Aryan and daughter Sara. But the instant change was when Dhaval met Aryan before his 10th boards. The jump from 50% to 70%; the inclination from Science to Commerce; just to name a few of the steady growth pattern in our Son. We can do only as much as our love allows us to, we grew up in a different era today our children our bombarded with the media and it's positives and negatives. The impact on our children's lives is immense hence thank you Holistree for being a guiding light / open communicator and the connect when disconnect happens..."

From my school life to my plans in the future, Dhaval has always been on my side, motivating and encouraging me. He has been very helpful and has been guiding me to the right path.

Career guidance is one of the key things one requires and Holistree is simply excelling in it.This journey has been stupendous and I would never like it to stop. Thanks a ton to Dhaval and Priya to start Holistree and hope you reach out to many more students and help them too!"

    <h1 id="phone-h1">6. SWADHA MEHTA</h1>
  <hr id="hr-4">
  <p id="phone-paragraph">"Holistree brought clarity in my life, whether it's about my career or my personal life.I have always been an average student, I never thought I'd be able to keep up with the scholars but after coming here, I'm slowly and steadily getting closer. Apart from that, a teenager goes through various problems, which act as hindrance in our studies, which we probably can't explain our parents, hence losing focus. Holistree taught me how to avoid such distractions and their long term impacts too. I have gradually transformed into a person which I always dreamt of and this was possible only because of their constant support and encouragement. They've always had my back."

  <hr id="hr-4">
  <p id="phone-paragraph">"Holistree's approach towards a child's career is totally one of a kind. Unlike judgement on the basis of written tests and interest, they look into each matter from current lifestyle to working style even after a student completes his or her education. The points and questions they mention definitely makes you think and you try to then see things in a little different way. I would definitely give holistree the credit in helping me out about my career and exposing me to all the opportunities out there. Thank you dhaval Bhaiya and Priya Didi :)"
